# cpprestsdk_mwe
Minimal working examples for how to use cpprestsdk


`get.cpp` shows how to make a `GET` request using CPPRestSDK.
It makes a request to `api.chucknorris.io`, and then prints the joke:

```bash
$ make get.x
$  ./get.x
"If light is the fastest traveling element known, then Chuck Norris is not an element"
```
